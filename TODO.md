MAJOR:
* Better hit detection for player.
* Center should have a UI for the actions / score / current level (AKA "release cycle"/"sprint").
* Sounds for each action.
* Music should play in loops / tracks.
* Reset in the middle of an obstacle tween is bugged sometimes.
* Change color of track according to position of player.
* Highlight an obstacle which moves.
* Reduce duration of tween as difficulty increases as well.
* Proper UI for game start / about / other stuff.
* Mute option should be saved to localStorage.

MINOR:
* Some particle effects for fun.
* A background.
* A wire-frame for the track.
* Highscore - use rails :D
